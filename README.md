# ![Logo/CanGrow_favico_large.png](Logo/CanGrow_favico_large.png) CanGrow - An OpenSource grow controller firmware for ESP8266 / ESP32

CanGrow is a firmware for ESP microcontrollers to control and monitor all plant needs. It can be understood as lightweight alternative to HomeAssistant for plant growing systems.

## üå± Features

- Support for ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers
- Everything runs on the ESP microcontroller itself, no need for HomeAssistant
- Lightweight WebUI with integrated Dashboard
- Dasboard with Gauges and simple Linechart
- Data Logging into builtin flash with LittleFS for the line chart to see past 32 hours
- Free and flexible configuration of outputs (GPIO, HTTP, I2C) and sensors (builtin ADC, I2C modules)
- Sensor values offered by JSON API `/api/sensor/`
- Platform independent - Build your own hardware and drive it with the CanGrow firmware
- Set different light times for Vegetation and Bloom phase
- Simple watering plans, based on time interval and/or sensor value

## üíæ Installation

You find in the [Releases](https://git.la10cy.net/DeltaLima/CanGrow/releases) section of the Git repository pre-compiled binaries which you can upload directly.  
The WLED project made a very good instruction how to upload a .bin File to the ESP. Please have a look here: [https://kno.wled.ge/basics/install-binary/#flashing-method-2-esptool](https://kno.wled.ge/basics/install-binary/#flashing-method-2-esptool)

Alternatively you can also build and upload the code by your own. Please have a look into the Section [Build Environment](#build-environment)

If you are interested in a mostly working and bleeding edge development release, check out the [pre-built snapshot binaries on pub.la10cy.net](https://pub.la10cy.net/CanGrow_builds/snapshot/)

## üîå Setup

After uploading the firmware to the ESP, you might want to perform a factory reset of the firmware.  
To do so, bridge the internal LED Pin to:

|ESP variant|GPIO|bridge to|
|-----|--------|--------------|
|ESP8266|D4 (2)|GND|
|ESP32 (NodeMCU, D1 Mini)|2|+3.3V|

During boot (LED flashes 3x) hold it and release after 3 seconds. The LED will flash fast and the ESP will reset and restart.

CanGrow creates a new Wifi by default

|SSID|Password|
|-------|--------------|
|`CanGrow-unconfigured`|`letitgrow!`|

## üî® Build environment
The helper script `cangrow.sh` is written for a **Debian 13** system. 

To install all dependencies you need for building the firmware, run the cangrow.sh setup:

```sh
$ ./cangrow.sh help
./cangrow.sh [setup|build|upload|webupload|monitor]
setup: setup build environment, download arduino-cli, install all dependencies for arduino ide
build: build firmware binary. will be saved into build/
upload: upload firmware by serial connection /dev/ttyUSB0
webupload: upload firmware with webupload to 192.168.4.20
monitor: serial monitor /dev/ttyUSB0

# Install all dependencies for build environment
$ ./cangrow.sh setup
```

The script installs [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) to `~/.local/bin/arduino-cli`. 

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compile

```sh
# compile and output to build/CanGrow_v0.2...bin
# Default Target is ESP8266 D1 Mini
$ ./cangrow.sh build

# Compile for ESP32 D1 Mini
$ export BOARD="esp32:esp32:d1_mini32"
$ ./cangrow.sh build

# Build and upload by serial USB connection for ESP32 (WROOM generic)
$ export BOARD="esp32:esp32:esp32"
$ ./cangrow.sh upload

# Build and webupload to IP
$ export IP="192.168.4.69"
$ ./cangrow.sh build # need to make .bin first
$ ./cangrow.sh webupload # upload

# listen to serial monitor on /dev/ttyUSB2
$ export TTY="/dev/ttyUSB2"
./cangrow.sh monitor
```

### ‚ôæÔ∏è Compile with Arduino IDE
You can also avoid using `./cangrow.sh setup` , for example if you are on a different Linux distribution or Operating System, like Windows or OSX.

For this, you just have to copy the content of the `libraries/` directory to your Arduino libraries Folder. This would be on
- Windows: `My Documents\Arduino\libraries\`
- Mac OSX: `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/`
- Linux: `~/Arduino/libraries/`

After this, you just have to ensure, you have the correct Arduino Core installed for your ESP you want to compile CanGrow for.  
How to add the ESP Arduino Cores is well described [in this Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Installing-ESP8266-and-ESP32-Core-in-Arduino-Windo/)

### ü¶≠ Podman / Docker build container
Just do a `compose up` with the container engine of your favor to build all supported firmware binaries
```sh
# With podman
$ podman-compose up ; podman-compose down

# With Docker
$ docker compose up ; docker compose down
```

To only build for one ESP platform (e.g. the ESP32 NodeMCU), just put the (supported) FQBN into the `BOARDS` environment variable:
```sh
$ echo 'BOARDS=esp32:esp32:esp32' > boards.env
$ podman-compose up ; podman-compose down
# just remove the file to build for all platforms again
$ rm boards.env
```

To update the build environment just run
```sh
# re-generate the whole container image (safest method, takes longer)
$ podman-compose build

# just re-run 'cangrow.sh setup' within the actual image before build
$ echo 'UPDATEBUILDENV=1' > updatebuildenv.env
$ podman-compose up ; podman-compose down
# dont forget to remove it, if you dont need an update afterwards 
$ rm updatebuildenv.env
```

## ü™î Geany IDE

I wrote this project using [Geany IDE. ](https://www.geany.org/). The Geany Projectfile is also included, just run
```sh
$ geany CanGrow.geany
```

**F8 compiles** the project, **F9 uploads** firmware to /dev/ttyUSB0. You can change these settings for .ino and .h files
in Project -> Settings -> Create/Make.

## üìê Development
